# üé® Freelander Customization Guide

Welcome to Freelander! This guide will help you customize your portfolio website without any coding knowledge. Everything is configured through one simple file: `config.yaml`.

## üìã Quick Start Checklist

1. ‚úÖ **Clone or download** Freelander template
2. ‚è≥ **Edit `config.yaml`** (this guide)
3. ‚è≥ **Add your portfolio images**
4. ‚è≥ **Choose your colors and fonts**
5. ‚è≥ **Deploy your site**

## üßë‚Äçüíº Personal Information Setup

All your personal information is stored in the main `config.yaml` file. Simply open this file and replace the example content with your own information.

### Step 1: Basic Information
In the `personal:` section of `config.yaml`:
```yaml
personal:
  name: "Jane Doe"                    # Your full name
  profession: "UX Designer"           # Your job title  
  tagline: "Creating beautiful, user-centered digital experiences"
  
  # Contact Information  
  email: "jane@example.com"
  phone: "+1 (555) 123-4567"          # Leave empty to hide: ""
  location: "San Francisco, CA"
```

### Step 2: Your Bio
```yaml
personal:
  bio_short: "UX Designer with 5+ years creating digital products that users love."
  bio_long: |
    I'm a passionate UX Designer based in San Francisco, specializing in 
    creating intuitive digital experiences for startups and established brands.
    
    **My background in psychology** helps me understand user behavior, while my
    technical skills allow me to create designs that developers can actually build.
    
    You can use **markdown formatting** like bold text, lists, and links!
```

### Step 3: Social Media Links
In the `social:` section, add your profiles. Leave empty (`""`) to hide:
```yaml
social:
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe"
  instagram: "https://instagram.com/janedoe"
  twitter: "https://twitter.com/janedoe"
  behance: "https://behance.net/janedoe"    # For designers
  dribbble: "https://dribbble.com/janedoe"  # For designers
  github: "https://github.com/janedoe"      # For developers
  website: ""  # Your personal blog/website
  
  # Professional Links
  resume_pdf: "/files/jane-doe-resume.pdf"  # Link to your resume
```

### Step 4: Profile Photos
Add your photos to the `static/img/profile/` folder:

**File structure:**
```
static/img/profile/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile.jpg        # Your main photo
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ profile@2x.jpg     # High resolution version (optional)
```

**Photo Tips:**
- Use professional, high-quality photos
- Recommended size: 800x800px for main image
- Use 1600x1600px for the @2x (retina) version
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for fast loading

## üéØ Professional Sections

### Show/Hide Sections
In `data/site.yml`, control which sections appear on your site:
```yaml
settings:
  sections:
    hero: true          # Main intro section
    about: true         # About you
    portfolio: true     # Your work
    experience: true    # Work history
    education: false    # Education background
    testimonials: false # Client testimonials
    contact: true       # Contact form
```

## üé® Visual Customization

### Colors
Choose your brand colors in `data/site.yml`:
```yaml

  primary_color: "#007bff"      # Your main brand color
  secondary_color: "#6c757d"    # Supporting color
  accent_color: "#28a745"       # Highlight color
```

**Color Tips:**
- Use hex codes (#123456) or color names (blue, red)
- Test colors for accessibility and contrast
- Keep it simple - 2-3 colors maximum

Choose your typography:
```yaml

  primary: "Inter, system-ui, sans-serif"     # Body text
