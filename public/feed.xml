&lt;p>Six months later, we had built a comprehensive design system that reduced development time by 40% and established visual consistency across 12 product areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how we did it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>DataFlow Pro had grown rapidly from startup to scale-up, but their design infrastructure hadn&amp;rsquo;t kept pace. The symptoms were familiar:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5 Principles of User-Centered Design That Actually Work</title><link>http://localhost:1313/blog/5-principles-user-centered-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 14:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/5-principles-user-centered-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>After 8 years of designing digital products, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen countless &amp;ldquo;user-centered&amp;rdquo; projects that somehow forgot about the users. The term gets thrown around so much that it&amp;rsquo;s lost meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Real user-centered design isn&amp;rsquo;t about following a checklistâ€”it&amp;rsquo;s about fundamentally shifting how you approach problems. Here are 5 principles that have consistently led to better outcomes in my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-start-with-problems-not-solutions">1. Start with Problems, Not Solutions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Principle&lt;/strong>: Understand what users are trying to accomplish before deciding how to help them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Figma Workflow: How I Design 40% Faster</title><link>http://localhost:1313/blog/figma-workflow-optimization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 09:15:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/figma-workflow-optimization/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year, I tracked my design time and discovered I was spending 3 hours daily on repetitive Figma tasks. That&amp;rsquo;s 15 hours per week that could be spent on actual design thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I optimized my workflow. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learned and the exact system I use now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-time-audit-results">The Time Audit Results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before optimizing, I spent time on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>25%&lt;/strong>: Looking for components and assets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>20%&lt;/strong>: Manually organizing layers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>15%&lt;/strong>: Recreating common layouts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>15%&lt;/strong>: Adjusting typography and spacing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>25%&lt;/strong>: Actual creative design work&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This was backwards. I was spending 75% of my time on mechanical tasks.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
